# Installation instructions

I don't really know how Python works. Someone please help me to make these instructions easier!!!

1. Use [the English version's instructions](https://www.builtree.org/handwrite/contributing/) for installing the *development* version of handwrite.
2. `pip install fonttools`
3. Use `handwrite -h` to see instructions on using the command-line tool. Some of those fields are necessary for naming your font correctly, and a friendly license is necessary for putting your font on Linku.
